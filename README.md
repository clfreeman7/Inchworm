# Inchworm
This repository details the design, fabrication, and control of a soft inchworm robot with embedded SMA tendons. 

## Morphology and Design

The morphology and design parameters of a soft, tendon-actuated inchworm are dependent on the following:
- actuator type (e..g., motor, SMA)
- actuator size and shape
- material properties
- expected environment interaction
- extent of self-containment / tethers
- desired control actions (e.g.,  inching, rolling, grabbing, turning)

However, the design can be generally categorized into three components:
1. Soft inchworm body
2. Hard endcaps
3. Tendons and channels

Figure 1 shows this basic morphology and the terminology for the design parameters.
### Fins (Prolegs)
Our current inchworm body design consists of 13 fins, which can be thought of as analogs to caterpillar prolegs. 
Similar inchworm robots have been designed with fewer fins https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/soro.2018.0082 https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8722784, more fins https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7527653, smaller, ridge-like fins, or no fins at all https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8722724

Rigid links https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6269102, https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9248054 have also been propossed.
