# Inchworm
This repository details the design, fabrication, and control of a soft inchworm robot with embedded SMA tendons. 

## Morphology and Design

The morphology and design parameters of a soft, tendon-actuated inchworm are dependent on the following:
- actuator type (e..g., motor, SMA)
- actuator size and shape
- material properties
- expected environment interaction
- extent of self-containment / tethers
- desired control actions (e.g.,  inching, rolling, grabbing, turning)

However, the design can be generally categorized into three components:
1. Soft inchworm body
2. Hard endcaps
3. Tendons and channels

Figure 1 shows this basic morphology and the terminology for the design parameters.
